    <p><em>Last updated: September 1, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
        Elevated Narratives LLC (“<strong>Elevated Narratives</strong>,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use and share it, and the choices you have.
    </p>

    <h2 id="info-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <li><strong>Information you provide.</strong> When you complete our quiz, request an Impact Review, make a purchase, or contact us, we collect information such as your name, email address, company, website/video URLs, and your quiz responses. If you buy something, our payment processor collects billing details on our behalf.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic data.</strong> We may receive device and usage information (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages viewed, time on page, referring/exit pages) via cookies or similar technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="how-we-use">2. How We Use Information</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="legal-bases">3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
    <p>We process personal data under these bases: (a) <strong>contractual necessity</strong> (to deliver your review or purchased services); (b) <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (to improve and secure our services); (c) <strong>consent</strong> (for optional marketing); and (d) <strong>legal obligations</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="sharing">4. How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information. We share data with service providers who help us operate (e.g., hosting, analytics, payment processing, email delivery). They may only use your data as instructed by us and must protect it. We may also share information to comply with laws, protect rights, or in connection with a business transfer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cookies">5. Cookies &amp; Analytics</h2>
    <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies to remember preferences and understand site usage. You can control cookies through your browser settings. If we offer a cookie banner or “Preferences” link, use it to adjust non-essential cookies.
    </p>

    <h2 id="international">6. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        We may process information outside your country. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) for cross-border data transfers.
    </p>

    <h2 id="retention">7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We keep personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described here (e.g., to deliver your review, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes). You may request deletion—see “Your Rights.”
    </p>

    <h2 id="your-rights">8. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access, correct, delete.</strong> You may request a copy of your data, corrections, or deletion where applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing opt-out.</strong> You can unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time via the link in our emails.</li>
        <li><strong>EEA/UK.</strong> You may object to or restrict certain processing, and you may lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.</li>
        <li><strong>California (CCPA/CPRA).</strong> You may request access/portability or deletion of certain information and opt out of certain sharing as defined by law. We do not sell personal information as defined by California law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="security">9. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect personal information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2 id="children">10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our services are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe a child has provided information, please contact us so we can delete it.
